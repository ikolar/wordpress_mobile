wordpress_mobile

I read a lot of blogs, but mostly from my PDA (iPhone touch or Nokia E71). Most blogs still aren't mobile friendly, meaning:
 - their feature RSS, but only with headlines, not full articles;
 - their main page is bloated with ads, menus and such, and/or sufferes chronical divitis;
 - they use flash excessively, oftentimes in places where it could have been avoided. The sad truth here is that the touch can play many many flv/h.264 videos, but not if wrappen in a silly flash player.
 - etc.

This is one of the tools I use to make reading these blogs easier.

Inside index.php, you will find some CSS and a passthru() commands that pipes 
the blogs index/post/.. page to some simple sed commands. Sed will take out
the header, footer, navigation and such, and print the jucy stuff in the
middle, with some mobile sugar.

An extra clean.sed is meant for site-specific stuff. You wouldn't believe
the non-standardness of wordpress blogs's html markup.

The php script also adds some navigation.

It's all very simple, really.
